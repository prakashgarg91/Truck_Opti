# 🎯 SALE ORDER QA TESTING - COMPLETION SUMMARY

## 📊 QA Testing Status: ✅ COMPLETED
**Date:** August 12, 2025  
**QA Engineer:** Claude Code  
**Repository:** https://github.com/prakashgarg91/Truck_Opti  
**Commit:** b418864 - 🔧 CRITICAL FIX: Sale Order Optimization Strategy Bug Fixed

---

## 🔧 Critical Issues Found & Fixed

### ✅ FIXED: Optimization Strategy Bug
**Issue:** Hardcoded optimization parameter prevented strategy differentiation
- **Location:** `app/packer.py` line 449
- **Fix:** Changed from `'cost'` to `optimization_strategy` parameter
- **Result:** Cost Saving and Space Utilization now produce different results

### ✅ FIXED: Strategy Parameter Passing
**Issue:** Optimization strategy not passed to recommendation function
- **Location:** `app/routes.py` line 1732
- **Fix:** Added `optimization_mode` parameter to function call
- **Result:** Proper strategy handling throughout the system
