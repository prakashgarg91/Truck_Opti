## 🔍 Self-Learning Error Resolution System

### Automated Error Learning Database (Agent-Driven)
```yaml
ERROR_LEARNING_PROTOCOL:
  on_error_encountered:
    1. agent_error_detective: Capture complete context (stack trace, environment, user action)
    2. agent_error_detective: Pattern match against existing error database  
    3. If new pattern: agent_debug_learner adds to knowledge base with solution
    4. If known pattern: specialist_agent applies proven solution, agent_testing_coordinator verifies effectiveness
    5. agent_debug_learner: Update prevention strategies and detection rules
    
  knowledge_base_structure:
    error_id: "unique identifier for tracking"
    error_pattern: "regex or signature for automatic detection" 
    symptoms: "user-visible behavior and error messages"
    root_cause: "technical explanation of underlying issue"
    solution_steps: "proven resolution procedure"
    prevention_rules: "code patterns/checks to avoid recurrence"
    file_locations: "specific files commonly affected"
    frequency: "how often this error occurs"
    resolution_success_rate: "effectiveness of current solution"
```

## 🧪 Comprehensive Testing Framework

### Screenshot-Based Testing Protocol
```yaml
MANDATORY_TESTING_SEQUENCE:
  
  pre_development_testing:
    1. Document current state with screenshots
    2. Identify all interactive elements (buttons, forms, links)
    3. Create test plan for affected functionality
    4. Record baseline performance metrics
    
  during_development_testing:
    1. Test each change immediately after implementation
    2. Screenshot before/after states for every interaction
    3. Verify related functionality still works  
    4. Document any unexpected behavior
    
  post_development_testing:
    1. Comprehensive button/form testing with screenshots

    4. Create RESOLVED_xxx.png for any issues fixed
    
  testing_loop_protocol:
    WHILE issues_found > 0:
      - Fix identified issue
      - Build application (if needed)
      - Re-test affected functionality
