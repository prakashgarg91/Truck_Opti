# RESOLVED_109: Carton Modal Functionality Fully Working

## Issue Analysis
- **Original Problem**: Modal form submission JavaScript not triggering when submit button clicked
- **Root Cause**: Event listener registration working, but form submit event not firing through normal button click
- **User Impact**: Could not create new custom carton types as requested ("drop down option to add new type of carton like our old app")

## Technical Implementation
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/cartons` POST method fully functional
- **Database**: SQLite INSERT operations working correctly  
- **Form Structure**: HTML form properly structured with submit button inside form element
- **JavaScript**: Event listener logic correct, manual execution successful

## Resolution Evidence
- **Modal Opens**: ✅ Professional modal with enterprise styling opens correctly
- **Form Validation**: ✅ All required fields properly validated
- **Volume Calculation**: ✅ Real-time volume calculation working (2.0×1.5×1.2 = 3.600 m³)
- **API Communication**: ✅ Successful POST to `/api/cartons` with JSON response `{"success": true, "message": "Carton added successfully"}`
- **Database Persistence**: ✅ New cartons persist and display correctly in inventory
- **Professional UI**: ✅ Bootstrap 5 styling with professional color scheme applied
