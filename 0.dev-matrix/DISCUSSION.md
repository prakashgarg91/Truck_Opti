[2026-03-30] MANAGER-AUDIT:
  Full launch-readiness audit performed. All dev-matrix files read and verified.

  IN-REPO STATUS:
  - Build: PASS (6.00s, 0 TS errors, dist/sw.js generated)
  - npm audit: 0 vulns (root + frontend)
  - Git tree: CLEAN, on origin/main
  - All BATCH21 tasks verified done
  - Stale TASK.md queue entries removed (BATCH16-T1→T5, T-107, T-117)
  - LAUNCH_CHECKLIST counts verified accurate (40/45)

  CONCLUSION: ALL in-repo code work is COMPLETE.
  5 remaining items are external/owner-only actions (see report).

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[2026-03-29] MANAGER-VERIFY:
  OpenCode completed the code/security pass and pushed 3 commits:
  de2840ea, 48e55427, cb0daa1a

  Independent manager verification:
  - frontend build: PASS (`npm run build`)
  - root npm audit --omit=dev: PASS (0 vulnerabilities)
  - frontend npm audit --omit=dev: PASS (0 vulnerabilities)
  - git working tree: CLEAN

  Judgment:
  - Codebase is materially stronger and safer.
  - Project is NOT fully launch-complete yet.
  - Remaining launch blockers are external/manual:
    1. production Razorpay keys
    2. Google OAuth production credentials
    3. Twilio/Supabase OTP configuration
    4. DB backup / PITR owner action
    5. authenticated smoke test still not evidenced end-to-end

  Dev-matrix follow-up:
  - STATE.md corrected to reflect code-ready but not fully launch-ready status
  - LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md corrected to 40/45 complete

  HUMAN NEEDED: Razorpay live keys before T1 can be validated.

## 🔄 GIT PUSH PROTOCOL

```bash
# Build
cd d:\Github\Truck_Opti\frontend && npm run build   # 0 TS errors required

# Commit
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: description"

# Push
git push origin main     # GitHub first
git push heroku main     # Heroku second

# Verify
# heroku logs --tail --app truck-opti-app
```

---

## 🛑 NEVER DO

| Never | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Push with TS build errors | Heroku deploy broken |
| Push to Heroku before GitHub | Main branch falls behind |
| Mark task done without testing user flow | Silent failures shipped |
| Use `USING (true)` on user-owned table | Cross-tenant data leak |
| Expose Supabase error.message to UI | Info leak |
