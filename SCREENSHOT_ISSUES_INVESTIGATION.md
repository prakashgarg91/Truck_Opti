# Screenshot Issues Investigation Report

## Initial Application State Assessment
- **Date of Assessment**: 2025-08-15
- **Application URL**: http://127.0.0.1:5001
- **Critical Observations**:

### 1. Sale Order Processing Issues
- ðŸ”´ NO direct navigation to Sale Orders page found
- ðŸ”´ Routing for sale orders appears to be missing or broken
- ðŸ”´ Dashboard looks incomplete and non-functional

### 2. Systematic Testing Blocked
- Unable to test sale order processing due to routing/navigation issues
- Recommended immediate code review of:
  - `app/routes.py`
  - `app/templates/sale_orders.html`
  - Sale order processing logic

### Preliminary Conclusion
The application appears to be in a critically non-functional state. Comprehensive code review and reconstruction of routes and templates is necessary before detailed feature testing can proceed.

### Next Steps
1. Verify application routes
2. Check database connectivity
3. Validate template rendering
4. Investigate potential build/configuration issues

**Detailed investigation of remaining screenshot issues pending until basic application functionality is restored.**
