# CLAUDE.md - Master Orchestrator & Module Router

## üéØ CORE: Intelligent Module Delegation System

**Main CLAUDE.md = Orchestrator + Router + Universal Rules**  
**Sub-modules = Specialized Workspaces with Agents, Context & Tasks**

## Universal Development Laws (Apply Everywhere)

### Law 1: Understand Before Acting
Read existing code, understand patterns, research best practices

### Law 2: Verify Every Change  
Test changes, check for regressions, validate functionality

### Law 3: Maintain Consistency
Follow existing patterns, maintain architecture coherence

## üîÄ INTELLIGENT MODULE ROUTER
