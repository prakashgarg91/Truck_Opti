# CLAUDE.md - Master Orchestrator & Module Router

## 🎯 CORE: Intelligent Module Delegation System

**Main CLAUDE.md = Orchestrator + Router + Universal Rules**  
**Sub-modules = Specialized Workspaces with Agents, Context & Tasks**

## Universal Development Laws (Apply Everywhere)

### Law 1: Understand Before Acting
Read existing code, understand patterns, research best practices

### Law 2: Verify Every Change  
Test changes, check for regressions, validate functionality

### Law 3: Maintain Consistency
Follow existing patterns, maintain architecture coherence

### Law 4: Screenshot Analysis & Resolution Protocol
Proactively analyze all screenshots in project for issues and provide solutions

### Law 5: Complete User Testing Protocol
Before saying work is done check each function one by one as actual user will and then build then check built each button/function one by one after listing each button visible or that might appear after any function, run this button testing in loop till all problems are resolved

### Law 6: Screenshot-Based Button Testing Protocol
For testing each button, press the button take the screenshot analyse it then proceed further - every button interaction must be validated with visual evidence

### Law 7: Comprehensive Task Tracking Protocol
Maintain detailed task list in TodoWrite tool for every user request. Track all tasks from initial request through completion with status updates, evidence of completion, and resolution documentation.

### Law 8: Professional UI/UX Design Standards
Implement enterprise-level design with professional colors, robust features, and polished user experience. Every interface must meet commercial software quality standards.

## 📸 SCREENSHOT ANALYSIS & RESOLUTION PROTOCOL

### Mandatory Screenshot Review Process:
```yaml
SCREENSHOT_ANALYSIS_TRIGGER:
  when: ["user mentions screenshots", "screenshot directory detected", "visual issues reported"]
  action: "automatically scan and analyze all project screenshots"
  priority: "HIGH"

SCREENSHOT_CATEGORIES:

### Screenshot Testing Loop Protocol:
```yaml
TESTING_CYCLE:
  condition: "FOR EACH button in button_inventory"
  process:
    1. "Take BEFORE screenshot"
    2. "Interact with button"
    3. "Wait for complete response"
    4. "Take AFTER screenshot"
    5. "Analyze visual results"
    6. "Document any issues found"
    7. "Mark button status (PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL)"
  
  regression_cycle:
    condition: "WHILE (failed_buttons > 0)"
    process:
      1. "Fix identified button issues"
      2. "Rebuild application if needed"
      3. "Re-test previously failed buttons"
      4. "Take new validation screenshots"
      5. "Update button status"
      6. "Continue until all buttons PASS"
      
  completion_criteria:
    - "All buttons have BEFORE/AFTER screenshot pairs"
    - "All button interactions result in PASS status"
    - "All screenshots show professional, error-free interfaces"
    - "All dynamic content displays correctly"
    - "All user feedback mechanisms function properly"
```

### Quality Gates for Screenshot Testing:
```yaml
ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA:
  zero_visual_errors: "No broken layouts, missing content, or visual glitches"
  zero_functional_failures: "All buttons perform their intended actions"
  professional_appearance: "Interface maintains commercial software quality"
  complete_feedback: "All user actions provide appropriate visual/textual feedback"
  error_handling: "All error conditions display user-friendly messages"
  
EVIDENCE_REQUIREMENTS:
  documentation_complete: "BEFORE/AFTER screenshots for every interactive element"
  issue_tracking: "All problems documented with visual evidence"
  resolution_validation: "Fixed issues re-tested with new screenshot evidence"
  build_validation: "All button tests repeated on final executable build"
```

This protocol ensures every button interaction is visually validated and documented with screenshot evidence, providing complete assurance of professional functionality.

    requirement: "test EVERY button, link, form field that could be affected by the fix"
    method: "screenshot-based testing protocol"
    validation: "BEFORE and AFTER screenshots for each interaction"
    
  build_verification:
    requirement: "test all fixes in built executable version"
    process: "build application, test every clickable element, capture evidence"
    acceptance: "ALL elements must work perfectly in production build"
    
  regression_testing:
    requirement: "ensure fixes don't break existing functionality"
