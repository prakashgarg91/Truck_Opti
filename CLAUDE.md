  critical_error: "escalate to ERROR_CLAUDE.md + SECURITY_CLAUDE.md"
  resource_conflict: "escalate to PROJECT_CLAUDE.md for prioritization"
```

## üì∏ SCREENSHOT ANALYSIS & RESOLUTION PROTOCOL

### Mandatory Screenshot Review Process:
```yaml
SCREENSHOT_ANALYSIS_TRIGGER:
  when: ["user mentions screenshots", "screenshot directory detected", "visual issues reported"]
  action: "automatically scan and analyze all project screenshots"
  priority: "HIGH"

SCREENSHOT_CATEGORIES:
  unresolved_issues: "screenshots_problems_in_exe/*.png"
  resolved_issues: "screenshots_problems_in_exe/RESOLVED_*.png"
  new_findings: "any new screenshots or issues discovered"
  
ANALYSIS_WORKFLOW:
  1. DISCOVER: "scan project for all screenshot files"
  2. CATEGORIZE: "identify resolved vs unresolved issues"
  3. ANALYZE: "examine each unresolved screenshot for specific problems"
  4. PRIORITIZE: "rank issues by severity and user impact"
  5. RESOLVE: "implement fixes for identified problems"
  6. VALIDATE: "test fixes and capture resolution evidence"
  7. DOCUMENT: "update resolution status and create RESOLVED_ screenshots"
```

### Screenshot Analysis Framework:
```yaml
ANALYSIS_DIMENSIONS:
  ui_ux_issues:
    - "visual layout problems"
    - "styling inconsistencies" 
    - "responsive design failures"
    - "color scheme problems"
    - "font visibility issues"
    
  functional_problems:
    - "broken features or workflows"
    - "loading issues or errors"
    - "data display problems"
    - "form validation failures"
    - "navigation problems"
    
  performance_issues:
    - "slow loading screens"
    - "processing delays"
    - "memory or resource problems"
    - "optimization opportunities"
    
  user_experience_gaps:
    - "missing functionality"
    - "confusing interfaces"
    - "accessibility problems"
    - "mobile compatibility issues"
```

### Resolution Implementation Protocol:
```yaml
RESOLUTION_STEPS:
  immediate_fixes:
    priority: "CRITICAL"
    timeframe: "same session"
    examples: ["critical UI breaks", "non-functional features", "data loss risks"]
    
  high_priority_improvements:
    priority: "HIGH" 
    timeframe: "within current task"
    examples: ["visual inconsistencies", "poor UX", "performance issues"]
    
  enhancement_opportunities:
    priority: "MEDIUM"
    timeframe: "next development cycle"
    examples: ["feature additions", "visual polish", "optimization"]

RESOLUTION_DOCUMENTATION:
  format: "RESOLVED_[number].[brief_description].png"
  location: "screenshots_problems_in_exe/"
  metadata: 
    - "original issue description"
    - "solution implemented"
    - "code changes made"
    - "validation evidence"
```

### Automated Screenshot Actions:
```yaml
ON_SCREENSHOT_DETECTION:
  scan_directories: ["screenshots_problems_in_exe/", "screenshots/", "docs/images/"]
  identify_unresolved: "files without RESOLVED_ prefix"
  analyze_issues: "extract problem descriptions from filenames and content"
  create_resolution_plan: "prioritized action items for each issue"
  implement_fixes: "code changes to address identified problems"
  capture_evidence: "new screenshots showing resolution"
  update_documentation: "mark issues as resolved with evidence"

SCREENSHOT_NAMING_CONVENTION:
  problem_format: "[ISSUE_DESCRIPTION].png"
  resolved_format: "RESOLVED_[number].[ISSUE_DESCRIPTION]_[resolution_type].png"
  examples:
    - "LOADING_SCREEN_NOT_WORKING.png" ‚Üí "RESOLVED_103.Loading_screen_functionality_implemented.png"
    - "POOR_UI_COLORS.png" ‚Üí "RESOLVED_104.Professional_color_scheme_applied.png"
```

### Integration with Development Workflow:
```yaml
SCREENSHOT_DRIVEN_DEVELOPMENT:
  code_review: "include screenshot analysis in every code review"
  testing: "validate fixes with before/after screenshot evidence"
  deployment: "ensure all critical UI issues resolved before release"
  monitoring: "continuous screenshot-based quality assurance"

QUALITY_GATES:
  no_critical_ui_issues: "all CRITICAL screenshots must be resolved"
  visual_consistency: "UI/UX standards maintained across application"  
  user_experience: "all user workflow screenshots show proper functionality"
  performance_validation: "loading and processing screenshots show acceptable speeds"
```

This protocol ensures systematic identification, analysis, and resolution of all visual and functional issues captured in project screenshots, maintaining high quality standards throughout development.
