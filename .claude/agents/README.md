### Workflow Patterns

#### Feature Development
```
Product Strategist → Project Orchestrator → Technical Lead → Specialist Agents
```

#### Bug Fixing
```
Code Reviewer → Optimization Specialist → Appropriate Specialist
```

#### Architecture Changes
```
Chief Architect → Technical Lead → All Relevant Specialists
```

## Agent Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Each Agent

1. **Strategic Decisions**: Chief Architect, Product Strategist
2. **Complex Integration**: Technical Lead, Project Orchestrator
3. **Backend Development**: Backend Architect, Full-Stack Developer, Database Developer
4. **Frontend Development**: Frontend Architect, UI Component Developer, State Performance Specialist
5. **Security & Auth**: Auth Security Developer, DevOps Security Specialist
6. **Testing & Quality**: QA Automation Lead, Automation Testing Engineer, Code Reviewer
7. **Infrastructure**: DevOps Security Specialist, Infrastructure Engineer
8. **Documentation**: Documentation Specialist, Code Reviewer

### Cost-Effective Workflows

1. **Start with lower-tier agents** for implementation tasks
2. **Escalate to higher-tier agents** only when complexity requires it
3. **Use specialists** for focused domain expertise
4. **Coordinate through leads** to maintain architectural consistency

## Configuration Files

Each agent has a dedicated configuration file with:
- Agent description and responsibilities
- Technical specializations and skills
- Cost level and priority
- Reporting structure
- Trigger conditions for engagement
