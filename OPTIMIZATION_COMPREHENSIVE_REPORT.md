   Form Present: ‚úÖ
   Carton Selection: ‚úÖ
   Functionality: ‚úÖ Working

2. FIT CARTONS IN SELECTED TRUCKS:
   Page Status: ‚úÖ Loads
   Truck Selection: 0 selectors found
   Carton Selection: 1 selectors found
   Interactive Elements: 22 total
   User Experience: ‚úÖ Manageable

3. FLEET OPTIMIZATION:

   Should Show: BEST POSSIBLE TRUCK WITH CARTON FITTING VISUALIZATION

5. OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM PERFORMANCE:
   Scenarios Tested: 3
   Success Rate: 100.0%
   Average Processing Time: 10.13ms
   Algorithm Status: üü¢ EXCELLENT

6. 3D VISUALIZATION INTEGRATION:
   /fit-cartons: 0/4 3D elements
   /fleet-optimization: 0/4 3D elements
   /packing-result: 0/4 3D elements
   /recommend-truck: 0/4 3D elements


CRITICAL USER EXPERIENCE ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
1. CATEGORY OF TRUCK SHOWING, BUT OPTION TO ADD CATEGORY NOT THERE
2. Recommend Truck for Cartons NOT WORKING
3. Fit Cartons in Selected Trucks - WHY ALL TRUCK SHOWING? User confusion
4. Truck Requirement Calculator SHOULD SHOW BEST POSSIBLE TRUCK WITH FITTING
5. Menu items not fully visible - UI overlap issues
6. Charts getting overlapped by option menu


ALGORITHMIC ISSUES:
No critical algorithmic issues detected.


RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMMEDIATE IMPROVEMENT:

1. üî¥ CRITICAL - Fix "Recommend Truck for Cartons":
   - Ensure carton selection mechanism works
   - Display clear recommendations with truck types
   - Show cost and efficiency comparisons

2. üî¥ CRITICAL - Improve "Fit Cartons in Selected Trucks":
   - Don't show ALL trucks - implement smart filtering
   - Add truck capacity indicators
   - Show real-time fitting visualization

3. üü° HIGH PRIORITY - Enhance Calculator:
   - Show BEST possible truck recommendation
   - Include 3D visualization of packing
   - Display efficiency metrics and cost analysis

4. üü° HIGH PRIORITY - UI/UX Fixes:
   - Fix menu overlap issues
   - Ensure all menu items are visible
   - Prevent chart overlapping with menus

5. üü¢ MEDIUM PRIORITY - Add Truck Categories:
   - Implement truck category management
   - Allow users to add/edit categories
   - Group trucks by type (Light/Medium/Heavy)

PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT:
- Algorithm Speed: üü¢ EXCELLENT
- Reliability: üü¢ HIGH
- User Experience: üî¥ NEEDS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT

OVERALL OPTIMIZATION GRADE: B- (Functional but needs UX improvements)
