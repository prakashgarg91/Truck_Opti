## INCORRECTLY MARKED "RESOLVED" IMAGES (Examples)

| # | Image File | Claimed Fix | Actual Status | Evidence |
|---|------------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| 1 | `RESOLVED_74.Base_data_table_visibility_issue_1_fixed.png` | "Base data table visibility fixed" | ‚ùå STILL BROKEN | Shows "Error loading data: 'TruckType' object has no attribute 'category'" |
| 2 | `RESOLVED_33.Base_data_table_visibility_implemented.png` | "Table visibility implemented" | ‚ùì UNVERIFIED | Need to test actual functionality |
| 3 | `RESOLVED_48.Fleet_optimization_functionality_restored.png` | "Fleet optimization working" | ‚ùì UNVERIFIED | Need to test form submission |
| 4 | `RESOLVED_55.Settings_page_functionality_restored.png` | "Settings page working" | ‚úÖ ACTUALLY FIXED | Verified: Settings page loads and works |

## VERIFIED FIXES (Actually Tested)

| # | Image File | Issue | Fix Applied | Verification Method | Result |
|---|------------|-------|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| 1 | `RESOLVED_81.Multiple_browser_windows_exe_issue_fixed.png` | .exe opened multiple browser windows | Enhanced browser opening logic with `browser_opened` flag | Tested .exe startup | ‚úÖ VERIFIED FIXED |
| 2 | `RESOLVED_82.Sale_order_processing_exe_error_fixed.png` | "An error occurred during processing" in .exe | Fixed database schema and error handling | Tested sale orders page in .exe | ‚úÖ VERIFIED FIXED |
| 3 | `RESOLVED_83.Base_data_table_failed_to_fetch_fixed.png` | "Failed to fetch" in drill-down tables | Fixed TruckType model and API endpoints | Tested API endpoint directly | ‚úÖ VERIFIED FIXED |
| 4 | `RESOLVED_86.Settings_page_functionality_verified_working.png` | Settings page not working | Ensured UserSettings model works | Tested settings page in .exe | ‚úÖ VERIFIED FIXED |

## CRITICAL ISSUES STILL NEEDING ATTENTION

### üî¥ High Priority (Blocking User Experience)
1. **Chart UI/UX Quality** - Multiple charts need professional styling
2. **Text Truncation** - Hover tooltips are cut off
3. **Information Architecture** - Progressive disclosure needed

### üü° Medium Priority (User Experience)
4. **System Timestamps** - Use actual system time for processing
5. **Relevant Information** - Add missing context where needed
6. **Decision Making Info** - Implement proper information hierarchy

## SYSTEMATIC VERIFICATION NEEDED

**Total Images**: 86 "RESOLVED" + 11 Unresolved = 97 images
**Actually Verified**: 4 images (4%)
**Still Need Verification**: 93 images (96%)

## RECOMMENDED APPROACH

1. **Stop marking images as "RESOLVED"** without actual testing
2. **Verify each "RESOLVED" image** by testing the actual functionality
3. **Create proper test cases** for each issue type
4. **Document exact verification methods** used
5. **Only rename files after confirmed fixes**

## LESSON LEARNED

**Previous Approach**: ‚ùå Assumed fixes worked based on code changes
**Correct Approach**: ‚úÖ Test actual functionality and verify with screenshots

The vast majority of "RESOLVED" images need re-verification through actual testing, not assumptions.

## ACTUAL STATUS SUMMARY

### ‚úÖ GENUINELY FIXED (4 issues - Verified)
1. Multiple browser windows in .exe
2. Sale order processing error in .exe 
3. Base data "Failed to fetch" errors
4. Settings page functionality

### ‚ùå STILL BROKEN (7+ issues)
1. Chart UI/UX quality and professionalism
2. Text truncation in tooltips ("Click to view actual da...")
3. Chart hover tooltip overlaps
4. System timestamp usage
5. Information hierarchy/progressive disclosure
6. Missing relevant information displays
7. + ~90 "RESOLVED" images that need re-verification

### üìä REAL COMPLETION RATE
- **Actually Fixed**: 4 out of 97+ issues = **4% completion**
- **Incorrectly Marked**: 86 "RESOLVED" without verification = **89% false positives**
- **Still Need Work**: 93+ issues = **96% remaining**

## URGENT ACTIONS NEEDED

1. **Stop creating false "RESOLVED" files** 
2. **Fix the 7 genuinely broken UI/UX issues**
3. **Systematically verify each of the 86 "RESOLVED" claims**
4. **Implement proper testing workflow** before marking anything as resolved

The current approach of marking issues as resolved without testing has created a massive tracking problem where 96% of issues still need attention despite appearing "resolved".
