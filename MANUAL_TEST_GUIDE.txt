TRUCK RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM - MANUAL VERIFICATION GUIDE
============================================================

AUTOMATED TESTS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!
All page elements, JavaScript functions, and form submission are working.

MANUAL VERIFICATION STEPS:
Follow these steps to verify the loading screen and algorithm info updates:

1. OPEN THE APPLICATION:
   • Open your browser
   • Navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:5004/recommend-truck
   • Verify the page loads completely

2. TEST ALGORITHM INFO UPDATES:
   • Locate the 'Algorithm & Optimization Goal' dropdown
   • Notice the 'Algorithm Info' panel on the right
   • Change the dropdown selection and verify:
     - LAFF Algorithm → Shows 'Largest Area/Volume First packing strategy'
     - Cost-Optimized → Shows 'Multi-truck cost analysis'
     - Value-Protected → Shows 'Prioritizes high-value items'
     - Balanced → Shows 'Optimal balance of all factors'
   • Algorithm info should update IMMEDIATELY when dropdown changes

3. ENTER TEST DATA:
   • Select a carton type (e.g., 'LED TV 32')
   • Enter quantity: 5
   • Choose algorithm: 'LAFF Algorithm - Maximum Space Utilization'
   • Verify algorithm info shows the correct description

4. TEST LOADING SCREEN:
   • Click 'Get Smart Recommendations' button
   • Immediately watch for:
     - Loading modal appears within 1 second
     - Shows 'LAFF Algorithm' in the title
     - Displays algorithm-specific steps
     - Shows spinning animation
     - Algorithm description is visible

5. VERIFY RESULTS:
   • Wait for recommendations to appear
   • Check that results show truck recommendations
   • Verify loading screen automatically closes

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
   - Algorithm info updates instantly when dropdown changes
   - Loading screen appears immediately on form submission
   - Loading screen shows specific algorithm being used
   - Algorithm steps are displayed during processing
   - User clearly sees something is happening

FAILURE INDICATORS:
   • Algorithm info doesn't change with dropdown
   • No loading screen appears
   • Form seems unresponsive
   • Generic loading message without algorithm info

TROUBLESHOOTING:
   • If algorithm info doesn't update: Check browser console for JS errors
   • If no loading screen: Verify recommend_truck.js is loaded
   • If form unresponsive: Check Flask server is running
