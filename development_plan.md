# Development Plan

This document outlines the plan for fixing bugs, improving core functionality, and adding new features to the TruckOpti application.

## 1. Bug Fixes

*   **Issue:** Packing jobs with no cartons are not handled correctly in the `add_packing_job` route.
*   **Resolution:**
    *   Modify the `add_packing_job` route in `app/routes.py` to check if a packing job has at least one carton.
    *   If no cartons are present, display a warning message to the user.
    *   Set the job status to 'failed' in the database.

## 2. Testing

*   **Objective:** Verify the bug fix and ensure the application's stability.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Update the end-to-end tests in `e2e-tests.js` to include a test case for creating a packing job with no cartons.
    *   The test should assert that a warning message is displayed and the job status is correctly set to 'failed'.

## 3. Core Functionality Improvements

*   **Objective:** Enhance the packing algorithm and provide better visualization.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Refactor `packer.py`:**
        *   Replace the current simple packing algorithm with a more advanced 3D bin packing algorithm (e.g., using a library like `py3dbp`).
        *   The new algorithm should consider carton orientation and stacking constraints for a more realistic packing solution.
    *   **3D Visualization:**
        *   Implement a 3D visualization of the packed truck using a JavaScript library like `three.js`.
        *   The visualization will be displayed on the packing result page.

## 4. New Features

*   **Objective:** Add significant new capabilities to the application.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **User Authentication:**
        *   Add user registration and login functionality.
        *   Secure the application by restricting access to authenticated users.
        *   Associate packing jobs with the users who created them.
    *   **Enhanced Analytics Dashboard:**
        *   Add more detailed statistics to the analytics dashboard (`templates/analytics.html`), such as:
            *   Average truck utilization.
            *   Most frequently used truck and carton types.
            *   Packing success/failure rates.
    *   **PDF Export:**
        *   Implement a feature to export the packing result page to a PDF document.
        *   This will allow users to easily share and print the packing layout.

## 5. UI/UX Improvements

*   **Objective:** Improve the user-friendliness of the application.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Truck and Carton Type Management:**
        *   Redesign the UI for managing truck and carton types (`templates/truck_types.html` and `templates/carton_types.html`) to be more intuitive.
        *   Allow for easier editing and deletion of existing types.
    *   **Search and Filtering on Packing Jobs Page:**
        *   Add search and filtering controls to the packing jobs page (`templates/packing_jobs.html`).
        *   Users should be able to search for jobs by name and filter by status (e.g., 'completed', 'failed').
